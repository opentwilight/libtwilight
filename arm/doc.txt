TODO: arm/starlet specific code goes here

A cross-compiler targeting the starlet processor would be built here,
any code that would assist in getting a starlet program using its hardware correctly,
as well as some examples of IOS code, something like an extremely simplified version of bootmii,
or cIOS patches, etc.

Maybe even some custom IOS in the future, eg. written from scratch?
Could allow for a more sophisticated use of the USB 2.0 standard, for example.
